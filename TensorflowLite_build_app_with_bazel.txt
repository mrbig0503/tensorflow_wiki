* Build command:
  -> bazel build --cxxopt=--std=c++11 //tensorflow/contrib/lite/java/demo/app/src/main:TfLiteCameraDemo

* Reference
  https://www.tensorflow.org/mobile/tflite/demo_android

* Building by Bazel is without Tensorflow/TensorflowLite AAR, it use the source code.
  Building by Android Studio is with Tensorflow/TensorflowLite AAR.
